# RealtimeTaskScheduler-OS-Level-Task-Scheduler
Engineered a multithreaded task scheduler in C++ with priority-based scheduling and aging to simulate OS-level process management. • Handled 10+ concurrent tasks using 4 worker threads, ensuring race-free execution with mutexes and condition variables. • Achieved &lt;50ms average task dispatch time with optimized scheduling and modular design .
